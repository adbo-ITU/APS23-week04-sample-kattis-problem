In Denmark they have a fun, yearly celebration that (like most other historical traditions) has a dark, disturbing origin. Every February 19th, children are encouraged to dress up in costumes and try to destroy a large wooden barrel hung in the air, simulating the joyful beating of a black cat to expel evil and witchcraft from your medieval village.

Two children, Amalie and Andreas, are partaking in this tradition in the Forgotten Realms, where the success of their bat swings are decided by the roll of a 20-sided die as well as their own innate strength modifier measured on a scale from -5 to 10. The quality of their batswing will be the sum of these two numbers UNLESS they run into either the joyful case of rolling a 20 or the devastating case of rolling a 1.

\section*{Input}
One line containing two integers D and M, where $1\le D \le 20$ and $-5\le M \le 10$ represent the dice roll and strength modifier respectively.

\section*{Output}
If the dice roll is 20 print "nat 20", if the dice roll is 1 print "crit fail!" and in all other cases print the sum of the dice roll and the modifier.
